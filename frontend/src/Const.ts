The development of the Prior2Do app has been discontinued and will not be maintained for the foreseeable future.

The app has now been released with my most recent progress on the new features on top of the previous releases, including:

- More powerful task management feature, including adding **Task Descriptions** and **Subtasks**.
- The **Tasks page** got some quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to sort tasks by different properties (task name, due date and estimated time), and the **Quick Add Task** feature makes it easier to create new tasks.
- A fully-featured **Tag** feature lets you organise your task by tagging it and filter tasks by tag.
- **Due Calendar** lets you conveniently view the due dates of your tasks on a calendar.
- The empowered **Task Plan** feature lets you plan multiple work sessions for a single task. It also lets you view your plan on a calendar (only available on a larger display)
- The app's home screen is now a **Dashboard** for all the handy information, such as showing your today's plan, tasks due recently, and other widgets.
- **Multilanguage UI** support.

The app will still work standalone, but bugs are expected as the app is not thoroughly tested. Due to insufficient development time, the cross-device sync feature, **Prior2Do Sync**, will also not be available in this version. Also, this app version is completely incompatible with the app data from previous versions.

The project is mainly developed as a **proof of concept** and is not expected to be used on a daily basis.

Anyway, have a nice and productive day!
